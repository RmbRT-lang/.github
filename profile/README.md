Coming soon. I'm currently rewriting the standalone compiler to be more easily maintainable and extendable.

## (Preliminary) Roadmap

1. Feature-complete stand-alone compiler (rmbrtc) for executables.
1. RmbRT object files, ahead-of-time template compilation, pre-compiled project dependencies/libraries.
1. Full debugging support.
