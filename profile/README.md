# RmbRT Programming language

The RmbRT programming language is a Christian programming language, in that it seeks to fulfill the virtues that Yahweh our God likes:
* to take joy in the Word, to make speaking and reading the truth pleasant,
* to not touch the unclean, I tried my best to create something pure.
* to take joy and comfort in your toil and to labour for things that satisfy,
* to dedicate the works of your hands to honour Yahweh; I hope that this language will be respected and that all the honour will be credited to Yahweh.

It is pronounced as "rmbrt" (no vowels, German "r").
Just deal with it, I'm not going to rename it.
If you have to, just call it RL instead.

If you use this language for the glory of God and lawful purposes, may you be blessed in the works of your hands.
If you use this language for lawless and evil purposes, may you be cursed with AIDS and monkeypox and evil spirits and demons.
Only use this language if you are a Christian â€“ don't defile what another man dedicated to the glory of God.

This blessing and this curse are above your stupid licenses and mortal laws so don't even try to get around that, God is not tricked.

## Why use RL over C/C++, in one simple picture

## Status

More information and documentation coming soon. I'm currently rewriting the self-hosted compiler to be more easily maintainable and extendable.

* You can already use the [`bootstrap compiler`](https://github.com/RmbRT-lang/rmbrtbc) to compile RmbRT programs, but it's still a bit buggy due to technical limitations (such as using C++ as the intermediate language).
* See [`rmbrtc`](https://github.com/RmbRT-lang/rmbrtc) and [`std`](https://github.com/RmbRT-lang/std) to get an impression of what the language is like.

## Mission

RmbRT language is intended to be a programming language for *experts* who love their craft.
It aims to fulfill the following features:

* Great performance,
* compact & readable code (only if you are an expert, albeit),
* simple syntax,
* expressive mechanisms for using higher abstractions and concurrency.
* timeless:
  must be usable for centuries without getting old. That's why I will be improving on it and fixing things until it can survive the ages.
  I am sick of seeing these half-baked programming languages that are a pain to use and who force false conceptions of computers on you.

It is designed to allow writing clean, expressive, and safe code, without being overly academic or annoying.
Its simple syntax and higher level concepts are intended to allow for easy development of additional tooling such as analyzers and model checkers.

## NOT Mission

* Compatibility with existing software stacks.
* Compromises in the design.
* Backwards compatibility.
* Corporate use.
* Lawless use.
* POSIX compliance/compatibility.

## (Preliminary) Roadmap

1. Feature-complete self-hosted compiler (rmbrtc) for executables. (currently WIP, expected by the middle of 2023, Yahweh willing)
1. RmbRT ASM object files, ahead-of-time template compilation, pre-compiled project dependencies/libraries.
1. Full debugging support.
1. Full language documentation.
1. Decentralised code repositories.
1. Decentrally attested compilation.
