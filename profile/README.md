# RmbRT Programming language

![RmbRT-lang-chud](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518378/184537409-a47a6add-1056-4092-8114-67d76a7a0cfe.png)


Coming soon. I'm currently rewriting the standalone compiler to be more easily maintainable and extendable.

* You can already use the [`bootstrap compiler`](https://github.com/RmbRT-lang/rmbrtbc) to compile RmbRT programs, but it's still a bit buggy due to technical limitations (such as using C++ as the intermediate language).
* See [`rmbrtc`](https://github.com/RmbRT-lang/rmbrtc) and [`std`](https://github.com/RmbRT-lang/std) to get an impression of what the language is like.

## (Preliminary) Roadmap

1. Feature-complete stand-alone compiler (rmbrtc) for executables.
1. RmbRT object files, ahead-of-time template compilation, pre-compiled project dependencies/libraries.
1. Full debugging support.
1. Full language documentation.
